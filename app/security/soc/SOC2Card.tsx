              SOC 2 is an audit report developed by the American Institute of

                  Type II:

                window (typically 6 months).

            <p className="text-xs leading-6  text-muted-foreground">
              SOC 2 is not mandatory in a legal sense, and certification is not
              required by law.
            </p>

            <p className="text-xs leading-6  text-muted-foreground">
              Still, we believe that SOC 2 is crucial because it encourages
              companies to have solid controls in place to protect customer
              data.
